        <h3>Recipe Courtesy of <em>Pick Up Limes</em></h3>
        <p>I highly recommend this recipe which I have made many times. It's borrowed from <em>Pick Up Limes.</em></p>
        <p>Energy balls are a great, easy-to-transport snack. These are deliciously sweet, with a creamy, oozy, nutty filling. Take a few with you to keep you charged all day or enjoy as a simple evening snack with a cup of tea.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup (160 g) soft dates, pits removed</li>
            <li>½ cup (68 g) roasted unsalted cashews</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp (13 g) Dutch processed cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp (9 g) toasted sesame seeds</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp (7 g) ground flaxseeds</li>
            <li>1½ Tbsp (22 mL) peanut butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the dates, cashews, cocoa powder, sesame seeds, and flaxseeds to a food processor.</li>
            <li>Blend until uniform in texture and holds together when pressed between your fingers.</li>
            <li>Scoop 2 Tbsp of the mixture into your palm and form into a ball.</li>
            <li>Use your finger to create a crater in the center of the date ball.</li>
            <li>Dollop about ½ tsp of peanut butter into the crater.</li>
            <li>Cupping the filled ball, pinch the edges closed around the peanut butter.</li>
            <li>Roll the filled energy ball back into a sphere.</li>
            <li>Transfer it to a plate. Repeat with the remaining date mixture and peanut butter. If desired, coat with toasted sesame seeds or cocoa powder. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
