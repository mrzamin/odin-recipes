        <p>Famous for being a late night drinking dish, Drunken Noodles is a marriage between my Thai and Chinese roots. The sauce seems complicated, but it’s as simple as measuring and dumping in a bowl. Fresh rice noodles are a deli item at most Asian markets. They are made and delivered fresh daily to the markets. It’s best to buy and use them within 48 hours. A way to tell if they are fresh is just to take the pack and fold it like a towel. If you can fold until the ends touch and the middles aren’t cracking, that’s a sign of freshness.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 table spoons sweet soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tabke spoon oyster sauce</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>6 to 8 thai basil leaves</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons canola or peanut oil</li>
            <li>2 to 3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 to 2 serrano chiles, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>6 to 8 large shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
            <li>1/2 medium white onion, sliced</li>
            <li>4 cups fresh rice noodles, separated</li>
            <li>1 cup Thai basil leaves, loosely packed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grape tomatoes, halved</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make sauce: Combine all of the ingredients in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Prepare noodles: In a large saute pan, heat the oil over high heat. When you see a wisp of white smoke, add the garlic and cook, stirring, until light brown. </li>
            <li>Add the eggs and serrano chiles and cook, stirring, until the eggs are lightly scrambled and barely set, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add the shrimp and onion, folding constantly until the shrimp turn pink, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add the noodles, basil, tomatoes and sauce and toss to combine for about 3 minutes. Don't be scared to scrape the bits off the bottom before they burn. Cook for 1 additional minute until the noodles are cooked and coated well. Serve hot.</li>
